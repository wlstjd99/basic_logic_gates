# basic_logic_gates
### I made some basic gates like and,nand,or,xor gates
### And also made gates by using not only basic functions (0.5*x1+0.5*x2=0.7) but also weight changed functions (-1*x1+2*x2=-2)
### And also made more fit functions to (0,0)(0,1)(1,0)(1,1)rectangular. Using funtions like (-x1+1000*x2=1000)
